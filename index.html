                <p>I was in the Navy for 10 years prior to transitioning into my current role in the Technology
                    industry. And in those years, I’ve proven to be very versatile having worn many hats and
                    progressively worked through various roles within the organization. I would say I’m naturally
                    collaborative and I truly value the importance of connecting with people. </p>
                <p>In the military, I was a production manager, where I worked closely with our customers and different
                    work center supervisors to manage the full-cycle production efforts of each teams within our
                    organization to meet customer demands.</p>
                <p>Previously, I worked for one of the biggest technology companies in the area as a software engineer in
                    data and intelligence where I’ve created various dashboards and reports to visualize raw data to
                    help understand issues prior to product release. I’ve also automated processes as part of our daily
                    stress test of certain features to ensure we identify bugs before releasing it to the consumers and
                    making sure that the code has not regressed in the process.</p>
                <p>
                    I would like to find opportunities where I can further enhance my knowledge and skill sets by
                    developing software that directly impacts the end users.
