                        W3Schools provides a simplified and interactive learning experiences for web development that is
                        easy to understand and readily available for everyone. It offers a variety of tutorials and code
                        examples covering a range of web development technologies that is easy to understand. It also
                        provides a built-in code editor to experiment with code snippets for easy learning. This website
                        is useful for any developers of any skill level who is looking for interactive resource to
                        experiment with their web development skills. I consistently refer to this platform for any web
                        development activities to better understand html, css, and javascript. I have given W3Schools a
                        five star rating for the simplicity and usefulness of the platform. <br>

                        Stackoverflow is a user driven platform that provides collective knowledge around any type of
                        programming. You can search their rich database of questions and answers for almost any
                        challenges you may face in your programming career and the community will provide feedback and
                        explanations that will help you develop a solution that fit your requirements and needs.
                        Stackoverflow has been a key resource for any developers who has questions ranging from simple
                        queries to complex problems. I’ve always used this platform as a reference for any questions I
                        have regarding any type of programming. If you have a question about programming, Stackoverflow
                        will most likely have an answer. I have given Stackoverflow a four star rating because of the
                        rich collective knowledge but it can also be a little difficult to navigate especially if you
                        lack experience in the industry and can feel a bit of an information overload. <br>

                        MDN Web Docs is a free resource for in-depth documentation on web standards such as HTML5, CSS,
                        Javascript, and much more. MDN’s mission is to provide developers with the information they need
                        to easily build projects on the open web. A community of developers and other contributors keep
                        the MDN Web Docs up to date. The entire platform is essentially a wiki and anyone can add to or
                        edit the increasing collection of documentation and tutorials. MDN Web Docs is useful for all
                        types of web developers as it contains wealth of information around web technologies. It
                        provides detailed documentation of all web dev technologies as well as useful code snippets. I
                        use this platform as another source of information around web technologies to ensure I
                        understand concepts and implement them properly so that I can be up to date with the current
                        standards. I have given it a four star rating because of the lack of built in code editor to
                        allow users to experiment with code snippets.<br>

                        Reddit is a social news platform that allows users to discuss and vote on the content other
                        users have submitted. To help police the site and its content and prevent spammers from
                        bombarding readers, Reddit came up with the “karma” points. Users get karma by their comments
                        and links being up-voted by others in the community. Reddit is useful not only for programming
                        but for an incredible amount of information in almost every field of human knowledge. Users can
                        browse through many subreddits in coding and programming and sort it by relevance. This can be
                        useful on finding out new trends and questions relating to web development. I use Reddit to read
                        about programming topics to help me stay motivated and relevant in the industry. It can also
                        provide guidance in your career based on other people in the industry and what they have
                        experienced. I have given it a two star rating because it is not actually a web resource and
                        contents can be skewed based on the user. You still need to do your own due diligence and not
                        take anything here at face value as it may lead you to incorrect answers. However it is a good
                        for use as another reference. <br>

                        Youtube was originally created as a platform for anyone to post any video content they desired.
                        It was hoped that users could use the site to upload share and view content without restriction.
                        It has since grown to become one of the foremost video distribution sites in the world. It
                        provides tons of videos and tutorials that can help grow your foundational knowledge of web
                        development. It is a good resource for software developers of all levels since it has video
                        content on almost everything related to programming. I use Youtube daily as a video resource to
                        learn programming doing code-alongs. I also use it to gain another perspective on topics that
                        are complex and confusing to help solidify concepts in my head. I have given a four star rating
                        because of the amount of video resources available to us. It can be confusing to find the right
                        content for your needs since there are a lot tutorials and could potentially distract you from
                        your initial query. <br>

                        Google is an internet search engine. It uses a proprietary algorithm that’s designed to retrieve
                        and order search results to provide the most relevant and dependable sources of data possible.
                        It is an awesome first stop to find the information you need about anything. It is used by most
                        people and comes down to personal preferences for search engines. I use google daily to find
                        information I need to help me become a better developer. I also use it for daily questions
                        outside of programming and it is useful for everything and a great first source of information.
